					<h3 class="title">Leadership Abiltites</h3>
					<p class="description"> I know how to take initiative when needed and ensure that everyoneâ€™s perspectives and concerns are heard. This skill has let me connect with people on a deeper level of understanding and make others feel valued. I have used this skill during group activities, projects, and extra-curriculars. Alongside my ability to lead, I can effectively communicate with the people around me.</p>

				<section class="skills">
					<h3 class="title">Communication</h3>
                    <p class="description"> When working with others through engaging in conversations, participating in group discussions, or asking questions, communication is an essential skill in any setting. Being able to talk to my peers helps me adapt to my environment.</p>
				</section> 

				<section class="skills">
					<h3 class="title">Time Management</h3>
					<p class="description"> Time management is another key strength of mine that I am continuously improving on. I can delegate my tasks in a way where important tasks are my top priority, and I can also multi-task when necessary. This allows me to complete my work while also making sure I fulfill my personal responsibilities. This skill has been especially helpful when I have to manage heavy workloads and meet deadlines without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
